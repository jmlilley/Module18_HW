The total number of rides per day followed similar patterns when comparing 2022 and 2023. There are a number instances where the pattern appears to be shifted over by a day, which would correspond with the days for each year following on different days of the week. For example, a Sunday in 2022 would be a Monday in 2023. Almost every day in February of 2023 had a higher total number of rides compared to 2022, suggesting more users.

The pattern for total number of rides by hour was pretty much identical between 2022 and 2023. There were 2 peaks in the dataset at 08:00 and 17:00 (or 8:00 AM EST and 5:00 PM EST). This would correspond with the commuting pattern of most workers who get into the office at 9:00 AM and leave at 5:00 PM. 

There was more ridership in the southern portion of the map compared to the northern portion. It also appears that more stations have been added in 2023.

The casual riders had a higher average trip duration compared to the member riders. This would suggest that memeber riders are typically using the bike to get from point A to point B, whereas the casual rider may take a more leisurely ride and the reasoning for their ride varies greatly (indicated by the great volatility of the average ride duration between each day).

The top start stations were also the top 3 end stations. Given the names of the stations, it suggests that these are transportation hubs and the bike is used to connect the rider to another form of public transportation.
